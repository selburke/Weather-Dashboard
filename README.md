# Weather-Dashboard
This project is a Weather Dashboard which was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript. I implemented Fetch in my code to pull data from the OpenWeather API. I also included the use of Moment.js.

The user is able to enter the name of a city and then view the current weather in that city, along with the 5-Day Forecast for that city.
